The VET sector is on the frontline of Australia’s Skills Reform. Governments want to hear from you about changes that will shape the sector, now and into the future.

A stronger VET system will help you offer the highest quality and most relevant training to support a highly skilled workforce. Skills Reform will: 
-	change and streamline the way training and qualifications are designed 
-	improve industry engagement in the process 
-	help to strengthen quality standards and the VET workforce
-	build the capacity and capability of RTOs.

Have your say to help shape the future of Australia’s VET system.
