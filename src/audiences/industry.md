Have your say on Skills Reform to make sure you have access to people with the skills you need, now and in the future.

The future of Australia’s VET sector is important for many of Australia’s industries and employers. Skills Reform includes giving industry a greater role in shaping the future workforce. 

Reforms aim to simplify, rationalise and streamline national VET qualifications. This will help to make sure industries are getting the right people, with the qualifications and training ready for the job.

Governments want to hear about how your organisation or industry can be better engaged in the VET system, and what you think could be improved.
