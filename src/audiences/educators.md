Have your say on Skills Reforms to make sure the VET system continues to deliver the best quality training.

Changes to our VET system are underway through the Skills Reform. Reforms will help to lift quality standards and make sure VET providers have the capacity and capability to deliver the training needed for our workforce, now and in the future.

Governments want to hear about your experiences in the VET system, and what you think could be improved.
