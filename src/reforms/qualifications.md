## Overview
Have your say about improving the way we design qualifications and training in the VET sector.

Weâ€™re working with industries and the VET sector to improve the way qualifications are designed. The Skills Reform includes simplifying and streamlining national VET qualifications across industries.

Qualification design trials are being run through three Skills Organisation Pilots covering Human Services, Digital and Mining.

## Background

The Australian, state and territory governments have agreed that an immediate priority under the Heads of Agreement for Skills Reform is to simplify, rationalise and streamline national VET qualifications across industry occupation groupings and the Australian Qualifications Framework.

Better qualifications will help to strengthen the training system and support Australia's immediate recovery from COVID-19. Reforms could also support greater employee mobility, to meet the job and market demands of the future, leading to better outcomes for employers and learners.

There are more than 1,300 qualifications in the current national training system, 13 per cent of which have zero enrolments and 50 per cent having less than 222 enrolments between 2016-2018.

The complexity of the national training system hinders employers and learners from readily identifying the qualifications and skillsets they need to gain the right skills and build their workforce. Stronger employer collaboration is needed to foster cross-sector career pathways and maximise mobility for workers.
