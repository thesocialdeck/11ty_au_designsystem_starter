## Overview
We’re working with industries and the VET sector to improve the way qualifications are designed. The Skills Reform includes simplifying,  streamlining and rationalising national VET qualifications across industry occupation groupings and the Australian Qualifications Framework as an immediate priority, to strengthen the training system and support Australia’s immediate recovery.

Read the [Ministerial Statement – 9 October 2020](https://www.dese.gov.au/skills-reform/resources/ministerial-statement-9-october-2020). 

Qualification design trials are being run through three Skills Organisation Pilots covering Human Services, Digital and Mining, industry-led organisations funded by the Australian Government who are leading innovative projects to improve Australia’s VET system.  

The Skills Organisations Pilots will trial new evidence-led approaches to qualifications, with a focus on what will better meet the needs of employers and learners now and into the future.  

Trials will aim to achieve the following goals:

- Qualifications that recognise common skills, delivering broader vocational outcomes and promoting individual mobility and labour market resilience
- A reduction in unnecessary training product duplication
- A reduction in training product complexity
- An enhanced relationship between training products, training needs and employment pathways
- Greater training product flexibility and enhanced responsiveness to changing industry need
- Improved articulation and pathways between education sectors.

## Mining Skills Organisation Pilot

The first trial will be run by the Mining Skills Organisation Pilot (MSOP) and is aimed at designing better qualifications to enable the mining sector to create new jobs and support the Australian economy. Informed by an assessment of industry need and existing training products, the MSOP will work to develop a new apprenticeship for mobile plant diesel mechanics that incorporates critical skills from other occupations. This will address an immediate skills need that has been identified by the mining industry and provide learners with more career pathways.

## Qualification Design Trials evaluation

Trials provide an opportunity to design and test evidence-led approaches to training product design in the real world, without disrupting the VET system. The trials will be evaluated to build the evidence base required to inform the future standards and policies for national training products necessary to support a strong and adaptable national training system.

## Background

The Australian, state and territory governments have agreed that an immediate priority under the Heads of Agreement for Skills Reform is to simplify, rationalise and streamline national VET qualifications across industry occupation groupings and the Australian Qualifications Framework.

Better qualifications will help to strengthen the training system and support Australia’s immediate recovery from COVID-19. Reforms could also support greater employee mobility, to meet the job and market demands of the future, leading to better outcomes for employers and learners. 

There are more than 1,300 qualifications in the current national training system, 13 per cent of which have zero enrolments and 50 per cent having less than 222 enrolments between 2016-2018. 

The complexity of the national training system hinders employers and learners from readily identifying the qualifications and skillsets they need to gain the right skills and build their workforce. Stronger employer collaboration is needed to foster cross-sector career pathways and maximise mobility for workers.

## Qualifications Design Survey

Thank you to the 600 respondents who gave valuable insights and feedback to the Qualification Design Survey, which closed on 1 February 2021. 

It’s encouraging to see that 89% of you agree that the trials are testing the right design elements. 

Feedback was also provided on other design concepts, including the construction and description of training products, delivery and assessment, enterprise and foundation sills and globalisation. This feedback will inform future consultations as the qualification design trials progress – please watch this space for further consultation opportunities on qualifications reform.
