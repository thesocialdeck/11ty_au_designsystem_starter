## Overview
Vocational education and training (VET) is central to Australia’s economic growth and business productivity and is a key part of Australia’s economic recovery from COVID-19. The Commonwealth, state and territory governments have agreed to reforming the VET system to ensure it is delivering for learners and employers. This will equip Australians with the skills they need to upskill in current roles or apply to new and emerging jobs.

Improving industry engagement arrangements in the VET system is vital to these reforms. This paper seeks stakeholder views on improving industry engagement in Australia’s VET system.

Feedback provided will be considered by Skills Ministers and inform future arrangements. You are asked to consider your needs and expectations of the national training system and how you would like a future system to work.

The strength of Australia’s VET system is internationally recognised, we need to ensure it continues to respond to the needs of the market. However, we need to ensure Australia has a highly skilled workforce that is ready for the job market, now and into the future. The impacts of COVID-19, a rapidly changing economy and widening skills gap are changing the way we work – VET needs to respond to this. Australia needs a responsive and resilient workforce that delivers for businesses and employers.

Improving industry engagement is one of many measures Australian governments are taking to improve the national training system and VET sector. The [National Skills Commission](https://www.nationalskillscommission.gov.au/) and the [National Careers Institute](https://nci.dese.gov.au/) have been established, along with other reforms as set out in the [Heads of Agreement for Skills Reform](https://nci.dese.gov.au/).
