## Overview
A strong and well-supported training system will enable RTOs to strive for excellence and enhance the quality of training. 

This will benefit both learners and employers.

We want to hear from those who engage in the VET sector, including RTOs, employers, educators and learners, about:
* how we create a shared understanding of RTO quality and support RTO excellence
* what works and what doesn’t in the current Standards for Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) 2015
* how we ensure a high quality VET workforce now and into the future

## Background

Skills Ministers have committed to raising the quality of training delivered within the VET sector through:

-   revising the *[Standards for Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) 2015](https://www.asqa.gov.au/about/asqa/key-legislation/standards-rtos)* (the Standards)

-   improving the capability and capacity of RTOs for continuous improvement

-   developing a VET Workforce Quality Strategy.

These reforms aim to improve the quality of training across Australia. The reforms will lead to a shared understanding across the sector of what high quality training provision looks like. They will help to ensure the quality of training delivery goes beyond compliance with the Standards and achieves excellence in training provision.

A key focus of Quality reforms will be to strengthen the Standards, to ensure they are focussed on outcomes. Strengthening the Standards will make sure the minimum level of quality that an RTO must meet in order to operate within the national training system is sufficient and delivers positive outcomes for learners.

The development of a VET Workforce Quality Strategy (the Strategy) recognises the important contribution trainers and assessors make to a high-quality VET sector.

Trainers and assessors are at the front line of training delivery. They have a vital role in passing on industry relevant knowledge to learners to meet Australia's employment and productivity needs. The Strategy will aim to support RTOs and trainers and assessors to promote high quality, consistent training and assessment and support the diverse workplace roles within the sector.

These reforms build on findings from recent reviews within the vocational education and training (VET) sector, which highlighted opportunities to enhance quality in the VET sector. They include
