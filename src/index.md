Whether you’re an employer, employee, business owner, learner, apprentice, job seeker, peak body, union, employer association or Registered Training Organisation (RTO), you will likely have experience with the vocational education and training (VET) sector.

The VET sector supports and develops diverse skills across a broad range of industries. Importantly, a strong VET sector will ensure Australia has a highly skilled workforce ready for the job market, now and into the future.

Recognising the importance of a high quality VET system that works for everyone, Australian governments (both at the national and state and territory level) have agreed to immediately progress reforms in the following key areas:

* strengthening the role of industry and employers
* improving VET qualifications
* raising the quality of training

These reforms are the next step in improving Australia’s VET system, building on previous consultations and feedback received from across the sector.
